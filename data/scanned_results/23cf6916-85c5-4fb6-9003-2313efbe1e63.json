    "overview": "The security assessment of the repository revealed one low-severity vulnerability related to information exposure. Specifically, internal IP addresses are configured within the application's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting, which, combined with debug mode being active, could aid attackers in reconnaissance efforts. While not immediately exploitable for direct system compromise, such information leaks are considered poor security practice, particularly within the sensitive healthcare sector.",

      "overview": "The application's `settings.py` file explicitly lists internal IP addresses within the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configuration. This information, while not directly exploitable for code execution, represents an information leak that could be leveraged by an attacker during reconnaissance to map internal network infrastructure. Coupled with `DEBUG = True` in the same file, this significantly increases the risk of inadvertent information disclosure about the internal environment.",
      "details": "The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in Django is designed to protect against HTTP Host header attacks. However, including internal IP addresses ('192.168.0.111', '192.168.43.155') in this list reveals details about the internal network topology. In a healthcare environment, any information that could assist an adversary in understanding the network layout is critical. If this application were to be inadvertently exposed to the internet with these settings, an attacker could deduce internal network segments without requiring active scanning, aiding in targeted attacks. The presence of `DEBUG = True` further exacerbates this by enabling verbose error pages that might leak even more sensitive system information.",

          "name": "myHospital\\settings.py:28",
          "description": "Line 28 of myHospital/settings.py shows internal IP addresses listed in ALLOWED_HOSTS:\nALLOWED_HOSTS = ['192.168.0.111', '127.0.0.1', '192.168.43.155']\nThis is within the context where DEBUG is also set to True (line 26)."
        }
      ],
      "recommendation": "- For production deployments, ensure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` contains only the domain names or external IP addresses that the Django application should serve.\n- Never include internal IP addresses in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` when deployed to production environments.\n- Set `DEBUG = False` in all production environments to prevent information disclosure via verbose error messages.\n- Implement strict network segmentation and firewall rules to prevent direct access to internal IPs from external networks.\n- Review and adhere to Django's deployment checklist and security best practices.",
      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "In `myHospital/settings.py` at line 28, the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable includes internal IP addresses like '192.168.0.111' and '192.168.43.155'. To resolve this information disclosure vulnerability, especially for production, these internal IP addresses should be removed. Instead, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should only list the fully qualified domain names (e.g., `['www.example.com', 'api.example.com']`) or external IP addresses that the application is expected to serve. Additionally, ensure `DEBUG` is set to `False` for production deployments to prevent verbose error pages from revealing sensitive information. A corrected `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in a production-ready `settings.py` might look like `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.yourdomain.com', 'your.external.ip']` or similar, depending on deployment specifics. For development, a more permissive `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is acceptable but should not be migrated to production."
