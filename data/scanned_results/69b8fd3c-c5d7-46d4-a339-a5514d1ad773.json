    "overview": "This security assessment identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily related to insecure operational practices and external API interactions. A hardcoded JWT token was found, alongside the Flask application running in debug mode, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, a lack of timeouts in external API calls introduces reliability risks, and pervasive verbose error messages provide attackers with valuable internal system information. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the application's overall security posture and resilience.",

Running a Flask application with `debug=True` in a production environment is extremely dangerous.

This can be exploited to read sensitive files, modify data, execute system commands, and ultimately gain full control over the server. Furthermore, debug mode often exposes detailed tracebacks, environment variables, and other internal application details that can significantly aid an attacker in mapping out the system and identifying further vulnerabilities.
