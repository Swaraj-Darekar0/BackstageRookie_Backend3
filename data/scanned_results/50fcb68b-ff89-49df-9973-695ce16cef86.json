Key vulnerabilities identified include a critical hardcoded secret, a dangerous debug mode configuration in production, and a known vulnerable dependency. Additionally, several instances of missing network call timeouts and verbose error messages exposing internal details were found. Addressing these findings is crucial for enhancing the application's security posture and protecting against potential exploitation, denial-of-service attacks, and information leakage.",
