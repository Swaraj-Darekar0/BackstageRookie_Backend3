    "overview": "This security assessment of the `myHospital` repository, a healthcare sector application, identified one low-severity information disclosure vulnerability. The application's `settings.py` file includes internal IP addresses in its `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configuration. While not directly exploitable for code execution, this exposure can aid attackers in reconnaissance efforts, allowing them to map internal network infrastructure, which is a significant concern for sensitive environments like healthcare systems.",

This information can be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to map the internal network structure.",

In a production environment, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should only contain domain names or external IP addresses that the server is intended to respond to. Exposing internal IP addresses, even through this setting, provides adversaries with valuable insights into the internal network structure, which can be a stepping stone for more targeted attacks like internal network scanning, port scanning, or exploiting other services within those subnets. This is especially risky in the healthcare sector where internal network security is paramount.",

      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "In `myHospital/settings.py`, line 28, the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting includes internal IP addresses like '192.168.0.111' and '192.168.43.155'. To resolve this, these internal IP addresses should be removed. In a production setup, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should only contain fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) or public IP addresses that the server will respond to. For example, change `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['192.168.0.111', '127.0.0.1', '192.168.43.155']` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']`. For local development, `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` can be used with `DEBUG = True`, but this must never be deployed to production."
