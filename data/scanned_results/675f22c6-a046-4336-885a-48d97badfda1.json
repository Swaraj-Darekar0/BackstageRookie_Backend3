    "overview": "This security assessment identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, alongside several medium and low-severity issues within the application's codebase. The most severe finding involves the application being configured with debug mode enabled, which poses an immediate and significant risk to the production environment, allowing for arbitrary code execution. Additionally, a hardcoded authentication token and a vulnerable dependency were discovered, both of which could be exploited by attackers. Numerous instances of verbose error messages indicate a potential for information leakage. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the application's overall security posture and preventing potential compromise.",

Please try again later.') for all unhandled exceptions.\n- Log detailed exception information securely on the server-side for debugging purposes, using a robust logging framework that separates logs from client responses.\n- Consider integrating a centralized error monitoring service to capture and analyze exceptions without exposing them to end-users.",
      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "Refactor error handling in `app.py` and `routes\\payments.py` to prevent raw exception details from being returned to clients. Replace instances like `return jsonify({'msg': '...', 'error': str(e)}), 500` with generic error messages, e.g., `return jsonify({'msg': 'An internal server error occurred.'}), 500`. Ensure that `str(e)` is only used for server-side logging and not exposed in API responses. This applies to all occurrences where `str(e)` is returned in an error message."
