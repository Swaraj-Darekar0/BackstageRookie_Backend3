    "overview": "This security assessment of the myHospital application, a critical system in the healthcare sector, identified a significant information leakage vulnerability. The application's configuration inadvertently exposes internal network IP addresses, which, while not directly exploitable, provides valuable reconnaissance data to potential adversaries. This finding highlights a broader concern regarding secure configuration management and information hygiene within a sensitive environment, particularly given the co-occurrence of debug mode being enabled.",

      "overview": "The Django application's core configuration file, `settings.py`, includes internal IP addresses within the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting. This configuration, particularly when `DEBUG` mode is enabled, can inadvertently expose internal network topology to potential attackers, facilitating reconnaissance efforts against the organization's infrastructure.",
      "details": "The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting is a security measure in Django designed to prevent HTTP Host header attacks by specifying a whitelist of hostnames or IP addresses that the application should respond to. However, directly embedding internal IP addresses (e.g., '192.168.0.111', '192.168.43.155') in this setting represents an information leakage vulnerability. While not directly exploitable for remote code execution or data theft, revealing internal network addressing schemes can provide valuable reconnaissance data to adversaries. In a healthcare sector application, such information could aid attackers in mapping the internal network, identifying potential targets, or planning more sophisticated attacks. The presence of `DEBUG = True` in the same settings file further amplifies this risk, as debug information can reveal additional sensitive details during error conditions, making the overall configuration less secure.",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "name": "myHospital\\settings.py:28",
          "description": "The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting explicitly lists internal IP addresses, potentially exposing internal network configuration details:\npython\n26: DEBUG = True\n27: \n28: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['192.168.0.111', '127.0.0.1', '192.168.43.155']\n"
        }
      ],
      "recommendation": "- Remove all internal IP addresses from the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.\n- Only include legitimate public-facing domain names or hostnames that the application is intended to serve in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.\n- For development environments, consider using `['localhost', '127.0.0.1']` and ensure strict network isolation, or use specific hostnames that resolve to the development machine.\n- Ensure `DEBUG = False` in all production and staging environments to prevent sensitive information disclosure and other debug-related risks.\n- Utilize environment variables or a separate, non-version-controlled configuration file for sensitive settings like hostnames or internal network details.",
      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "In `myHospital\\settings.py` at line 28, the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting contains internal IP addresses like '192.168.0.111' and '192.168.43.155'. To resolve this information leakage vulnerability, you must remove these internal IP addresses. Modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list to only include the actual public domain names or hostnames that your Django application should respond to (e.g., `['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']`). For local development, it's safer to use `['localhost', '127.0.0.1']`. Additionally, verify that `DEBUG` is set to `False` for any production deployments to prevent sensitive debug information from being exposed."
