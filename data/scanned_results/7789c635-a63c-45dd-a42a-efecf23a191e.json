    "overview": "This security assessment of the InfluencerPay API identified critical vulnerabilities related to hardcoded secrets and debug mode exposure, posing severe risks including remote code execution and unauthorized access. Additionally, the report highlights potential denial-of-service vectors due to missing HTTP request timeouts and excessive error information disclosure that could aid attackers in reconnaissance. Prompt remediation of these findings is essential to prevent significant security breaches and ensure application stability.",
