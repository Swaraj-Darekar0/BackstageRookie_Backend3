    "overview": "The security assessment of the provided repository identified several vulnerabilities spanning critical, high, medium, and low severities. A critical finding involves the presence of a hardcoded JSON Web Token (JWT), which, if compromised, could grant unauthorized access. High-severity issues include the dangerous configuration of Flask debug mode being enabled, potentially allowing remote code execution, and the use of a vulnerable `aiohttp` dependency susceptible to request smuggling. Furthermore, the report highlights missing request timeouts in external API calls, which could lead to denial-of-service, and numerous instances of verbose error messages that expose internal system details. Addressing these findings is crucial for enhancing the application's overall security posture and reducing its attack surface.",

Please try again later.').\n- Implement custom exception handlers for different error types to provide more user-friendly messages without leaking internal details.",
      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "Review all instances where `return jsonify({'msg': '...', 'error': str(e)}), 500` appears. For each, change it to return a generic message to the client, for example: `return jsonify({'msg': 'An unexpected error occurred.'}), 500`. Ensure that the detailed `str(e)` is only logged on the server-side using `print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")` or preferably a structured logging system, and is not sent to the client."
