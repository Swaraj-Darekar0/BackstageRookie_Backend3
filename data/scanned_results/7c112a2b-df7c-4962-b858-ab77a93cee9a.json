    "overview": "This security assessment analyzed the provided codebase, identifying several critical and medium-severity vulnerabilities that pose significant risks to the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Key findings include the presence of hardcoded secrets, a critical Flask debug mode misconfiguration, and a widespread lack of request timeouts in external API calls. Additionally, the application is prone to sensitive data exposure through verbose error messages, which could aid attackers in reconnaissance. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and preventing potential exploitation.",

For development or testing, use a placeholder or mock token that has no real-world validity. If it needs to be a real token for testing against an environment, ensure it is loaded from a `.env` file or environment variables, similar to how `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is loaded in the same file.

Instead, map specific exception types to generic error messages (e.g., 'Internal Server Error' or 'Invalid Request').\n- Ensure that sensitive data is scrubbed or redacted from error messages before being logged or displayed.",
      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "The application exposes sensitive data in error messages by returning `str(e)` directly to the client at numerous locations (e.g., 'app.py:117', 'app.py:187', 'routes\\payments.py:115'). To fix this, you should replace `str(e)` with a generic error message for the client and log the full exception on the server for internal debugging.\n\nFor each instance, change:\npython\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error message for logging: {str(e)}\") # Keep this for server-side logs\n    return jsonify({'msg': 'A user-friendly message', 'error': str(e)}), 500\n\nTo:\npython\nimport logging\n\n# Configure logging at the top of your app.py or in a config file\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# ...\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logging.error(f\"Detailed error for server logs: {str(e)}\", exc_info=True) # Log full traceback\n    # Provide a generic message to the client\n    return jsonify({'msg': 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'}), 500\n\nFor specific known errors (e.g., `AuthApiError` as seen in `app.py:110`), you can provide more specific, but still non-sensitive, error messages. For example, `return jsonify({'msg': 'Registration failed', 'error': 'User with this email already exists.'}), 400` instead of `str(auth_err)` directly."
