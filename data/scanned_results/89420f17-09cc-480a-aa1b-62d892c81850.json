    "overview": "This security assessment identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities within the application, alongside important medium and low-severity issues. The most significant risks stem from exposed debug functionalities in a Flask application, which could lead to remote code execution, and the use of a vulnerable third-party dependency. Additionally, the widespread practice of exposing raw exception details in API responses and the absence of request timeouts for external calls present further avenues for exploitation and service disruption. Addressing these findings is crucial for enhancing the application's overall security posture and reducing its attack surface.",

      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "Across app.py and routes\\payments.py, many API endpoints return raw exception messages using 'str(e)'. To prevent sensitive data exposure, refactor error handling to return only generic messages to the client. Instead of `return jsonify({'msg': 'Failed...', 'error': str(e)}), 500`, change it to `return jsonify({'msg': 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.'}), 500` and log the detailed exception (`print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")` or use a proper logging library) on the server side."
