    "overview": "This security assessment identified several critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities within the application's source code. Key findings include a hardcoded JWT token, the application running in debug mode, a lack of timeout configurations for external API calls, and widespread verbose error messages. These issues collectively increase the attack surface and risk of sensitive information disclosure, denial-of-service, and potential remote code execution. Immediate attention to these findings is crucial to enhance the application's security posture, particularly by ensuring sensitive data is managed securely, production configurations are hardened, and error handling is resilient against information leakage.",
