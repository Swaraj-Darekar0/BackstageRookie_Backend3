    "overview": "The security assessment of the provided repository identified critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities across various components. A critical finding involves the hardcoding of a sensitive JWT token directly in the source code, posing a risk of information disclosure or potential misuse. A high-severity vulnerability highlights the activation of Flask's debug mode, which could allow arbitrary code execution in a deployed environment. Multiple instances of missing timeouts for external HTTP requests introduce potential denial-of-service vectors. Furthermore, numerous API endpoints expose verbose error messages, which could aid attackers in reconnaissance by revealing internal system details. Addressing these identified weaknesses is crucial to fortify the application's security posture and mitigate the risk of exploitation.",

      "details": "The variable `token` on line 14 of `tasks.py` is assigned a literal JWT string. Although the surrounding code attempts to verify this token using a `secret` obtained from environment variables, the token itself might contain sensitive claims or represent a valid session at the time it was generated. If this code is ever deployed or the repository is made public, an attacker could extract the token. Depending on its contents and validity, this could lead to unauthorized access (if it's a live token with sufficient permissions), user impersonation, or exposure of internal system identifiers or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).",

      "prompts_to_solve_the_vulnerability": "In `tasks.py`, at line 14, the JWT token is hardcoded. To remediate this, remove the hardcoded token. Instead of `token = \"eyJhbGc...\"`, load the token from an environment variable, a secure configuration file (that is not committed to version control), or generate a synthetic, non-sensitive token dynamically for testing purposes. For example, if testing a token validation flow, only hardcode the *structure* of a token (e.g., `header.payload.signature`) without sensitive data, and ensure the secret used for signing is ephemeral."

For example, change `return jsonify({'msg': 'Registration failed', 'error': str(e)}), 500` to `return jsonify({'msg': 'Registration failed due to an internal server error. Please try again later.'}), 500`. Ensure that the full exception details are logged internally for debugging purposes, but not exposed to the client."
